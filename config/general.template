#
# This is the general settings file for the ground station, there are only a few
# things that actually need settings, most of the rest are automatic or are settings
# for a specific wifi card or camera, which are really airside settings the ground
# side can match automatically.
#
# These settings are subject to change a little until 2.1 is released, 
#
#
# Note: this file is a template, it will be auto-updated if new settings are added. If
#       you delete settings or comment them out, they will be reset to the defaults the next
#       time the ground station boots
#
